# The-Hindu-headline-collector
This Python Script extracts just the news headlines from my favourite newsportal "The Hindu" from its website.

Purpose
--------
News is always available online.But there are advertisements along with the news which make it very inconvienent for any person who is in a hurry and just didn't had time to grab the newspaper early in the morning and probably wanted to check the news online.
Now I dont mean that the news agencies dont have the right to earn money because they work very hard to get news for us, but their may be people who may like more clean and direct interface to news.
For those users I have created a Python Script that scraps headlines from a very reliable news website.

Prerequisites
--------------
Python.<br>
selenium library for python.<br>
chrome webdriver in the chrome directory of your computer.

What does it do?

If you liked the clean environment of the hindu headline collector then try this one.It scraps all the info about each of all the headlines by automatically scraping all the headline links on the main site.
